# 🔥 Faith Henzen — Code, Coffee & Curiosity

Hey — I’m Faith. I turn ideas into clean, usable code and sprinkle a little ✨ on the web.
I ship fast, learn faster, and love building tools that make other people's lives easier.

- 🚀 Quick pitch: I build delightful web apps, scalable APIs, and intuitive dev tools.
- 🎯 Focus: reliability, developer experience, and joyful UIs
- ⚡ Superpower: turning fuzzy ideas into working prototypes overnight
